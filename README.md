# RWTH SSO Autofill by Patrick Graf

# How to install
Download the latest release & unzip the folder.
-> Go to your Chromium Browser

-> Manage Extensions 

-> Developer Mode: Enable 

-> Load unpacked 

-> Select the downloaded folder

-> Enable the extension

# How to use
Open the extension popup and fill out both fields:

Serial Number: something like "TOPT12345678"

OTP Secret (Sha1): a long string

It is recommended to create a new Token-Pair at IdmSelfservice for this Extension.

# What to expect
Once setup is complete, you will only need to fill out your password and click enter.
From there on, the extension will calculate the temporal OTP code, fill it out, and click enter on the way.
The extension can't be faster than the RWTH SSO server.
